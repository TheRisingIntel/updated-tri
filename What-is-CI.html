					<h1 class="page-title">What is Collective Intelligence?</h1>
				</header>
				<p>Sometime in 2021, an honorable state governor and professor visited Mohammed VI Polytechnic University, (UM6P). Just like many people 
					usually do, out of curiosity, he asked me, "What is Collective intelligence?". 
					As it may sometimes seem, this question does not present any questioner as an ignorant. It may only mean that they are yet to be informed or perhaps, 
					want to know even more!.</p>
				<p>Perhaps you have some ideas about what Collective Intelligence is, or you already have a bit of it in your business but you do not know how to upscale it. Maybe you are even one of many people who think unevasively about Artificial Intelligence (AI) whenever they hear someone mention Collective Intelligence (CI)? 
					Whichever it is, we value peoples' curiosity and the enthusiasm to recognizing the value of this emerging science. Although it may be in its crude form, there is no 
					doubt that you are already applying CI in at least one of your business activities or decision-making. So, what is Collective Intelligence?</p>
				<blockquote><p><a> Collective Intelligence is the ability of groups to outperform individuals in learning, decision-making, problem-solving, prediction, and other cognitive skills. 
					It is the scientific field studying the conditions of this phenomenon within teams, organizations, and societies.<small><a href="https://sci.um6p.ma/" target="blank">School of Collective Intelligence</a>, UM6P.</small> </a></p></blockquote>

				<h2>Artificial Intelligence or Collective Intelligence?</h2>
				<p>Unless you are used to the terms above before, your mind may still = get boggled about what differentiates AI from CI. Although, there is the meeting point between AI and CI, AI was made out of the peoples' CI. 
					CI is deeper, and wider. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/artificial_intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</a> is the branch of computer science which deals with the reproduction or mimicking (artificial) of human-level 
					intelligence, conscience, self-awareness, and knowledge, and thought in computer program. Collective Intelligence on the other is "human-shared 
					intelligence" (inborn/learnt, and can be changed at will), born out of human-human interactions, positive competition, and as a result of
					shared-interest (problem-solving), deliberation, diversity, tolerance, and consensual agreement, etc. The meeting point is where there is the interactions of people and 
					computers to augment collective intelligence. Having this augmentation will bring great opportunities to businesses in real ways.</p>			</p>
				<p>In case you are still wondering why you must facilitate collective intelligence in your organization, let me guide you to some published evidences. In a book edited by Mark Tovey, "COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE: Creating a Prosperous World at Peace", in the preface, Robert Steele wrote these words:</p>

				<blockquote><a> <p>"...I want all of us to come together to give our children, and the next seven generations, the gift of a prosperous world at 
					peace. All of our institutions are broken—it is now up to us as a <u> collective</u>." </p>
					<p>"...Such a revolution in the group mind of the human collective is the only means by which we can create 
						infinite stabilizing wealth that enables the assurance of a good life for all. Corruption, crime, and corporate misbehavior can be 
						reduced through the non-violent acquisition and sharing of legal, ethical, open information that is discriminated, distilled, and 
						disseminated on a “just enough, just in time, just right basis.”</span></p> </a> </blockquote>
					<p>According to <a href="https://www.clearpeople.com/blog/what-is-collective-intelligence-workplace" target="blank">ClearPeople,</a> <span class="definition"> 
					"The most important intelligence in the foreseeable is <em>not Artificial Intelligence </em> but, rather, a <em>Collective 
					Intelligence </em> that includes both people and computers. And this is where there is a major opportunity currently untapped 
					by many organisations".</span>
				<p>Our world is continuosly becoming more complex and nobody is totally confident of what tomorrow holds, just like we had no idea until covid-19 pandemic. 
				Tackling problems require making decisions which have multiple unknown outcomes, and several businesses own their survival to how collective their people can become, and on how fast they can aggregate diverse opinions to make most accurate predictions. By using collective intelligence, we
					have the needed data aggregation skills, decision intelligence, technology and multidisciplinary human skills to tackle any variant of uncertainties.</p>
				
				<h3>Four important markers of CI have been identified by researchers:</h3>
				<blockquote> <a><p>
					1. Knowledge Management: This include knowledge aggregation (Data collection), Data conversion, Prediction, Project/Group Management, Heterogeneous search and referral (wisdom of crowds), etc. <br>
					2. Collaborative Work: This include understanding of various personalities (Behavioural Management), Trainings (Academic and otherwise), etc. <br>
					3. Organizational Knowledge: This include being a sensemaker of aggregate and particular data, knowledge of Trade secrets, E-commerce knowledge, etc. <br>
					4. External Information: This means you having some useful information regarding Environmental Monitoring (e.g., for climate change mitigation), 
					Technology Monitoring (e.g., evolving collaborative tools), Customer Monitoring (business management), Government Monitoring (leadership and policies), Local Knowledge (e.g., community engagement knowledge), etc.
				</p> </a> </blockquote>
					<p>From the above stated markers, I am sure you will agree with me that a collective intelligence specialist is supposedly a 
						psychologist, data scientist, computer scientist, business manager, participative leader, collaborative learner, watchful 
						citizen, etc., and that you must do everything you can to make them help your organization. This is what <a href="services.html"><em>The Rising Intel </em></a> is offering to you, and we hope you will let us help your business. </p>
